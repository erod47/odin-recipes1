<p>My Titi Zenny's coquito is a staple within the Rodriguez/Carri√≥n family. A Puerto Rican take on the holidays' most beloved beverage, egg nog, the sweet, delicate coconut mixed with cinnamon masks the obscene amount of rum present, serving a rude reminder when you're already on your third cup.</p>
<p>My <em>titi</em>, or my aunt, taught me this recipe when I was living in Scotland. While she sells branded bottles all over the Latin-infused streets of Bushwick, Brooklyn, I used the coquito to impress my Scottish and British friends, often being lauded for being able to keep up with the Scots' drinking. Plus, I can't really cook so this was my contribution to our Friendsgiving.</p>
