<p>I am a <em>huge </em> foodie, but most of the time, I can't be bothered to cook</p>
<p>I found this recipe on Instagram from a private chef; it's incredibly simple with seven ingredients that you can buy anywhere, and this dish will have you feeling like you're living <em>la dolce vita</em></p>

<ol>

    <li>While boiling, halve cherry tomatoes</li>
    <li>Take gnocchi off the boil, fry in a pan coated in olive oil for 5 minutes or until golden brown</li>
    <li>In a separate pan, sautee onions, tomato paste, and garlic</li>
    <li>Add sliced cherry tomatoes in pan, reduce for about 8 minutes or until it turns into a sauce</li>
